    Insert the information in the form and the calculator will determine the operating cycle<br> 
    What is the operating cycle?<br>
    the operating cycle is the days required for a business to receive inventory, sell the inventory and get the cash from the sale of the inventory, the operating cycle plays a major role in determining the efficiency of a business.<br>
    How to calculate operating cycle?<br>
    To calculate operating cycle you should use the following formula:<br>
    operating cycle = days inventory outstanding + days sales outstanding<br>
    where:<br>
    days inventory outstanding (DIO) = (average inventory / cost of goods sold) * 365 days<br>
    days sales outstanding (DSO) = (average accounts receivable / revenue) * 365 days<br>
    example: company x in it's first year had<br>
    revenue = $12,000,000<br>
    cost of goods sold (COGS) = $7,000,000<br>
    accounts receivable = $1,800,000<br>
    inventory = $2,100,000<br>
    and in it's second year it had<br>
    revenue = $13,000,000<br>
    cost of goods sold (COGS) = $7,800,000<br>
    accounts receivable = $2,000,000<br>
    inventory = $2,500,000<br>
    calculate the operating cycle of this company?<br>
    first let's calculate the days inventory outstanding and days sales outstanding:<br>
    days inventory outstanding = (average inventory / cost of goods sold) * 365 days<br>
    days inventory outstanding = (average($2m, $2.5m) / $7.8m) * 365 days<br>
    days inbentory outstanding = 105 days<br>
    days sales outstanding = (average accounts receivable / revenue) * 365 days<br>
    days sales outstanding = (average($1.8m, $2.1m) / $13m) * 365 days<br>
    days sales outstanding = 109 days<br>
    and now we should calculate the operating cycle:<br>
    operating cycle = days inventory outstanding + days sales outstanding<br>
    operating cycle = 105 days + 109 days<br>
    operating cycle = 214 days<br>
    Why use operating cycle?<br>
    the operating cycle is used because it offers an insight into a company's operating efficiency. A shorter cycle indicates a more efficient and successful business because a short cycle is in an indication that a company is able to get enough cash to meet obligations and if the companys operating cycle is long then this company might have cash flow problems.<br>
